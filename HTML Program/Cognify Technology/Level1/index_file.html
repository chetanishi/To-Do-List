    <p> Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications. It encompasses everything from creating simple static pages to complex dynamic sites and interactive web applications. Web development can be broken down into three primary areas:

       <p> Frontend Development (Client-side): This involves everything that users interact with directly in their web browsers. It includes:

       <p> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for structure </p>
        
       <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for layout and design </p>
        
        <p> JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content </p>
        
        Frontend frameworks like  React, Angular, or Vue.js to streamline and enhance the development process. </p>
        
       <p> Backend Development (Server-side): This focuses on the part of the website or application that users don't see. It involves working with databases, server-side languages, and handling requests from the frontend.</p>

        <p> Backend development includes:  </p>
       <p> Programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, or Node.js  </p>
        
       <p>   Databases likeb MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL  for storing data  </p>
        
       <p> APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to connect the frontend with the backend. </p>
        
       <p> Full Stack Development:  This is the combination of both frontend and backend development, where a developer works on both the user-facing parts of a website and the server-side parts.</p>
